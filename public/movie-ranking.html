<h1>The Best Sit-Coms According to Daniel</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Sit-Coms of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>I have always been a huge Friends fan, but a few years ago a had a big depression and watching Friends helped a lot. This is by far the best Sit-Com ever created.</p>
<h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>Another great show but not as good as the previous one, The big bang theory was awsome for the first 9 seasons,
     then it kinda decreased a little in my opinion.</p>
<h3>The Fresh Prince</h3>
<p>I watched this one as a kid and I think this was the very first time I watched a Sit-Com, so I hold a very special place in my hart for this show.</p>
